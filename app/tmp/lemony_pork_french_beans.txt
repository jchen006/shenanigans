Sprinkle over the pork and leave to stand for 15 minutes.
To make the salad, boil the French beans for 2-3 minutes, strain, and run under cold water until chilled.
Combine with the butter beans, onion, basil and parsley.
To make the dressing, mix two tablespoons of the olive oil with half the lemon juice, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Pour half over the salad and toss lightly. Pour the remaining half over the rocket leaves and toss to coat.
Brush a preheated grill plate with oil and grill the pork, about one minute per side.
Remove from the grill plate and squeeze with the remaining lemon juice.
Pile the bean salad in the centre of four serving plates.
Top with an escalope of pork, then scatter the rocket over the top.
