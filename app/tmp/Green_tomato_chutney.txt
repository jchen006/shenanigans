Ingredients 
175g/6oz light brown sugar
150ml/5fl oz white wine vinegar
1 shallot, peeled, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, peeled, finely chopped
2cm/34in piece fresh root ginger, peeled, finely grated
1 red chilli, finely chopped
125g/412oz sultanas
600g/1lb 5oz green tomatoes, quartered
Instructions 
Heat the sugar in a frying pan until the sugar melts and caramelises.
Add the white wine vinegar, shallot, garlic, ginger, chilli, sultanas and green tomatoes and bring the mixture to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour, or until the chutney has thickened and you can draw a wooden spoon across the base of the pan so that it leaves a channel behind it that does not immediately fill with liquid.
Spoon the chutney into sterilised jars.
