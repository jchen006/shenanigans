Ingredients 
1 lemon, zest only
1 lime, zest only
2 tbsp coarse sea salt
320g/11oz fresh salmon fillet, skin removed, cut in half lengthways
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp olive oil
1 bunch English asparagus, woody ends removed
12 red chilli, seeds removed, cut into small thin strips
12 red onion, finely chopped
12 cucumber, peeled and seeds removed, cut into 1cm/12in cubes
3 heirloom tomatoes, skinned and seeds removed, cut into 1cm/12in cubes
12 lime, peeled, pith removed, finely chopped
2 tbsp white balsamic vinegar
few drops Tabasco sauce
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
Instructions 
For the salmon, mix the lemon and lime zests with the salt in a small bowl, then rub the mixture onto the salmon. Cover with clingfilm and marinate in the fridge for 15 minutes.
Brush the salt mixture off the salmon and pat dry.
Heat a frying pan or griddle over a high heat. Drizzle the olive oil over the salmon fillets and fry for 30 seconds on each side. Remove the salmon from the frying pan, dust with paprika, wrap in clingfilm and set aside to cool.
For the asparagus salsa, reserve 5cm/2in of the tips and slice the remaining stems into thin rounds. Slice the tips thinly using a Japanese slicer or vegetable peeler and set aside.
Mix the asparagus stems, chilli, red onion, cucumber, tomatoes and lime together in a bowl. Add the balsamic vinegar and a few drops of Tabasco sauce, to taste. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, spoon the salsa onto serving plates. Slice the salmon into eight slices and add two slices to each serving plate. Sprinkle over the coriander and top with the asparagus tips.
