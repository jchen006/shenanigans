Ingredients 
100ml/312fl oz single cream
1 vanilla pod, seeds only
250g/9oz strawberries, hulled
40g/112oz icing sugar
100g/312oz full-fat Greek-style yoghurt
10 lavender flowers
Instructions 
In a jug, mix together the cream and vanilla seeds until well combined. Pour the mixture into the lolly moulds until it reaches halfway up the sides.
Finely chop three strawberries and divide them equally between the moulds. Cover the tops of the moulds with cling film, then transfer to the freezer and freeze upright for at least 1 hour, or until the cream is beginning to solidify.
Meanwhile, blend the remaining strawberries to a smooth puree in a food processor. Remove 2 tablespoons of the puree and set aside in a bowl.
Add the icing sugar and yoghurt to the remaining puree and blend until well combined.
Soak the lavender flowers in the reserved puree for at least 10 minutes, then strain and add the puree to the strawberry and yoghurt mixture.
Fill the moulds with the strawberry and yoghurt mixture and cover each one with its lid.
Freeze the lollies for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. To remove the lollies from the moulds, dip them in hot water for a few seconds and release them. Serve immediately.
