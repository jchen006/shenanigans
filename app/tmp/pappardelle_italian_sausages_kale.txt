The Hairy Bikers
Ingredients 
1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, finely sliced 
2 Italian-style sausages, casing removed
1 tsp chilli flakes, optional
2 tbsp white wine 
50g/2oz kale or other greens, tough stalks removed, leaves finely chopped
5 tbsp double cream 
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
200g/7oz fresh pappardelle pasta
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
50g/2oz parmesan, shaved
Instructions 
For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the garlic and fry gently for about 30 seconds. Crumble in the sausage meat, turn up the heat to high, and cook for 4-5 minutes, until the meat starts to turn golden-brown at the edges.
Stir in the chilli, if using, and the wine, then bubble for a few minutes until the liquid has evaporated.
Meanwhile, blanch the kale in a pan of boiling, salted water for 2-3 minutes until tender. Drain and add to the pan with the sausage meat. Mix until well combined, then add the cream and simmer for 2-3 minutes.
For the pasta, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta according to packet instructions. Drain well, reserving some of the cooking water, then put into a large bowl with the olive oil and finely chopped parsley. Mix until well combined and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Add the pasta to the sauce, adding a ladleful of the pasta cooking water to loosen the consistency then stir in the parmesan. Serve in warm pasta bowls.
