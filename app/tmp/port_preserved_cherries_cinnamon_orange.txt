Ingredients 
300g/1012oz soft light brown sugar
150ml/5fl oz port
1 tsp cinnamon
1 orange, zest and juice
350g/12 oz cherries
Instructions 
Sterilise a 725ml/114pt Kilner or jam jar (and its lid) in the dishwasher on the hottest wash or carefully put them in just-boiled water (off the heat) for a couple of minutes and dry with a clean towel.
Put the sugar, port and cinnamon in a small saucepan and finely grate the orange zest in. Halve and juice the orange, adding the juice with 150ml/5fl oz water.
Then bring everything slowly to the boil, stirring every so often until the sugar dissolves. Let it boil away for three minutes until thick and syrupy. Set aside to cool completely.
Meanwhile, wash the cherries and remove their stalks if wished, but I think they look great left on. Place them into the prepared jar.
Pour the cooled syrup over the cherries and leave to sit at least overnight. They will keep a week if kept nice and air-tight in the jar.
