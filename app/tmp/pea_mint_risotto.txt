Ingredients 
1 tbsp olive oil
14 onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, sliced
200g/7oz risotto rice
3 tbsp white wine
about 570ml/1 pint hot chicken stock
50g/2oz fresh peas or frozen peas, defrosted
1 small handful fresh mint, chopped leaves only
2 tbsp double cream
25g/1oz butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper
two handfuls rocket leaves
drizzle olive oil
drizzle balsamic vinegar
parmesan shavings
Instructions 
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, add the onion and garlic and fry gently for three minutes or until softened but not coloured. Stir in the rice and stir well for 2-3 minutes, until the grains turn translucent at the edges.
Pour in the wine and increase the heat to medium high. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the wine has been absorbed. Add a ladleful of the hot chicken stock and stir continuously until all the stock has been absorbed, then repeat until all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is cooked but still slightly firm (al dente).
Stir in the peas, mint, cream and butter and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover with a lid and leave to cook gently for 2-3 minutes.
To serve, toss the rocket with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar and scatter over the parmesan. Spoon the risotto into warm bowls and serve the salad alongside.
