Ingredients 
400g tin butter beans, drained
2 fat garlic cloves
10 sun-dried tomatoes
75g/212oz fresh basil, reserve a few leaves to garnish
4 tbsp lemon juice 
pinch chilli flakes
salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 courgettes, trimmed
2 large ripe avocados, skin and seeds removed, chopped
red chilli, chopped, for garnish
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Instructions 
For the pesto, blend all of the ingredients  and 9 tablespoons water to a rough paste in a food processor. Add extra water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
For the courgetti spaghetti, peel spaghetti-like strands from the courgettes using a julienne peeler, collecting them in a large mixing bowl.
Scrape the pesto on top of the courgette strands and carefully stir until the courgette is evenly coated.
To serve, pile the courgetti spaghetti and pesto onto serving plates and top with the chopped avocado, reserved basil leaves, chopped chilli and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
