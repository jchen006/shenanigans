Roll the beef mince into golf ball-sized pieces and set aside.
Pour 1.2 litres/2 pints of water into a large saucepan and bring to the boil, then drop the meatballs into the water followed by the potato and cabbage. Simmer gently for 5-10 minutes.
While the meatballs are simmering, heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the carrots, beetroots, onions and peppers and fry over a medium heat for about five minutes until they start to soften.
