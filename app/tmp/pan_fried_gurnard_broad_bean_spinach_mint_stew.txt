Ingredients 
4 tbsp olive oil
200g/7oz new potatoes, lightly scraped then quartered lengthways
12 onion, peeled, sliced finely 
1 garlic clove, peeled, finely chopped
400ml/14floz chicken stock
salt, to taste
200g/7oz frozen shelled and podded broad beans, thawed
250g/9oz spinach, chopped
10g/12 oz fresh mint leaves, sliced finely 
freshly ground black pepper, to taste
4 x 175g/6oz gurnard fillets, pin boned, skin scored
110g/4oz streaky bacon, cut into lardons
Instructions 
Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan and fry the onion and potatoes gently for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened but not brown.
Add the garlic and cook for a further minute.
Add the stock and season with salt, to taste. Bring the stew to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.
Add the broad beans and cook for a further minute. Stir in the chopped spinach and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted. Finally, stir in the mint and season with freshly ground black pepper, to taste.
Heat a frying pan until hot, add the remaining olive oil and fry the gurnard fillets, skin side down, for 2-3 minutes, or until just crisp. Flip the fillets over and continue to cook for another two minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.
Remove the gurnard from the pan and set aside to rest for 1-2 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a separate frying pan and  fry the bacon lardons for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.
To serve, divide the stew between two bowls, top each with two gurnard fillets and sprinkle over the bacon lardons.
