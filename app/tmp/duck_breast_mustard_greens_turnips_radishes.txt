Ingredients 
boneless duck breasts (34)
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
vegetable oil

fresh lemon juice
olive oil, divided
radishes, thinly sliced
small turnips, scrubbed, thinly sliced, plus 2 cups torn turnip greens or kale

Instructions 
Preheat oven to 400. Score fat side  of duck breasts 18" deep in a crosshatch pattern; season both sides with kosher salt and pepper. Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Cook 2 duck breasts, skin side down, until fat is rendered and surface is deeply browned and crisp, 1015 minutes; transfer to a plate. Wipe out skillet and repeat with remaining duck and 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil. 
Arrange all duck breasts in skillet, fat side up, and roast in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of breasts registers 135, 58 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes and up to 2 hours.
Whisk Dijon mustard, mustard powder, lemon juice, and 3 Tbsp. olive oil in a small bowl; season mustard sauce with kosher salt and pepper. 
Toss radishes, turnips, greens, flowers (if using), vinegar, and remaining 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large bowl; season with kosher salt and pepper. 
Thinly slice duck. Scatter greens  over a platter (or two) and top with duck. Sprinkle with sea salt and serve with mustard sauce alongside.
