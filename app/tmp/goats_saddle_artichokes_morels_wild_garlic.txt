Ingredients 
30g/1oz salted butter
600g/21oz goat's rack and short saddle (aged for 2 weeks), trimmed
2 artichokes, trimmed, chokes removed, cut into quarters
50g/134oz morel mushrooms, roughly chopped 
salt and black pepper
1 tsp lazy garlic (1 garlic clove blended with 1 tsp olive oil)
3 tsp sherry vinegar
150ml/5fl oz gravy
150g/5oz wild garlic, roughly chopped
Instructions 
Heat the butter in a pan until foaming. Place the goat in with the butter and fry for 6-10 minutes, basting all the time - cook the meat longer, if you prefer your meat more well done. After a few minutes, add the artichokes. Remove and place on a carving dish, covering loosely with foil, and rest for at least six minutes.
Blanch the morel mushrooms for ten seconds in a pan of salted boiling water. Drain thoroughly and add the morels to the pan used to cook the goat and cook for three minutes.
Add the lazy garlic, cook for 15-20 seconds, or until fragrant, and then deglaze with the sherry vinegar. Once the vinegar has evaporated, add the gravy and bring to the boil.
Add the wild garlic and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the meat in slices with the morels and wild garlic on the side.
