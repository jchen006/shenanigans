Ingredients 
2 tbsp butter
3 apples, peeled, sliced
3 tbsp dark brown sugar
6 free-range eggs, separated
1.5 litres/212 pints full-fat milk 
6 tbsp caster sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
Instructions 
Melt the butter in non-stick frying pan, add the apples and dark brown sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes or until the sugar has dissolved  and the apples have caramelised.
Meanwhile, whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until they form soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.
Pour about 900ml/112 pints of the milk into a saucepan and bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to a simmer. Add three tablespoons of the caster sugar and stir until dissolved.
Gently drop a large tablespoonful (although you can make them as big or small as you like) of the egg white into the simmering milk and poach for two minutes. Remove the poached meringues using a slotted spoon and place in a shallow dish. Repeat until all the egg whites have been used. Keep the milk warm.
In a clean bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining caster sugar until pale and thick, then slowly stir in the remaining cold milk, whisking continuously.
Pour the milk and egg yolk mixture into the saucepan of hot milk used to cook the egg whites and stir continuously over a low heat for five minutes, or until the mixture starts to thicken. Stir in the vanilla extract, remove from the heat and set aside to cool for about 20 minutes.
To serve, arrange the caramelised apples in the bottom of serving bowls, reserving the juices. Pour the cooled custard over the apples, then top with the egg whites. Spoon over the caramelised apple juices and serve.
