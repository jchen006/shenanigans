Lorraine Pascale
Ingredients 
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (not a syrupy one)
1 tsp Dijon mustard
flaked sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tsp olive oil
4 peaches, almost ripe but not too soft, quartered and stoned
200g/7oz ball buratta, drained and torn into chunks (or 2 x 125g/412oz balls mozzarella)
70g/212oz bag rocket
1 bunch of basil, leaves only, roughly torn
Instructions 
For the dressing, lightly whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Season to taste and set aside.
For the peaches, lightly grease a griddle pan or barbecue with the oil and then get it nice and hot. You may have to work in batches, depending on the size of your pan. Place the peach quarters, cut-side down on the griddle pan or barbecue for 1-2 minutes to give a nice chargrilled mark on them.
Use a metal fish slice to help lift them up so as not to leave the chargrilled marks behind. Turn them onto their other cut side for another minute (dont cook on their skin side). The charring will add to the flavour. You can also use a frying pan to cook them, but obviously you wont get the char-grilled lines on them. Sit the peaches cut side up on a large serving platter as you go.
Arrange the buratta chunks (or mozzarella) around the peaches and scatter the rocket and basil leaves over. Scatter a little salt and pepper on top. Quickly whisk up the dressing again if necessary, drizzle it over and serve.
