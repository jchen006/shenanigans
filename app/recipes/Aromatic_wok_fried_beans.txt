2 garlic cloves, finely sliced
12 a fresh red chilli, seeds removed and thinly sliced
3cm/114in piece of fresh ginger, cut into matchsticks
4 spring onions,finely chopped
4 water chestnuts, thinly sliced

Instructions 
Heat the oil in a wok over a high heat. Once hot, add the garlic and chilli and stir-fry for 10 seconds to soften. Add half the ginger and all the spring onions, along with the water chestnuts, peanuts and dried shrimps, and stir-fry for 30 seconds.
Add the green beans to the wok and stir-fry. The beans should begin to blister and turn slightly golden. Once everything begins to soften, add the Shaoxing rice wine, fish sauce and soy sauce and cook for a further 10 seconds.
Add four tablespoons of hot water. Leave to steam for a further 45 minutes until the water is almost evaporated and the beans are hot through but still crunchy.
Add the remaining ginger and season the mixture with caster sugar, white pepper and sesame oil. Serve piping hot.
