Ingredients 
2 garlic cloves, peeled, left whole 
small bunch fresh parsley, leaves only
85g/3oz chopped walnuts
500ml/18fl oz rapeseed oil
pinch salt
350g/12oz cooked leftover salmon fillet, flaked
2 tbsp shredded smoked salmon
1 tbsp ready-made mayonnaise
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
splash balsamic vinegar
4 large firm tomatoes, cut in half from top to bottom, seeds removed and reserved
salt and freshly ground black pepper
150g/5oz French beans, trimmed
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp Dijon mustard
2 small shallots, sliced
Instructions 
For the parsley oil, blend the garlic, parsley and walnuts as finely as possible in a food processor, then gradually add the oil in a thin stream, blending continuously, until smooth and well combined. Season, to taste, with salt. Set aside until needed.
For the stuffed tomatoes, in a large bowl, mix together the flaked salmon, smoked salmon, mayonnaise, garlic, ketchup and balsamic vinegar until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Stuff the tomato halves with the filling mixture. Set aside.
For the green bean and shallot salad, blanch the beans in a large pan of salted, boiling water for 1-2 minutes. Drain well and run under a cold tap to refresh.
In a bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar and mustard until well combined. Add the blanched beans and the shallot rings and stir to coat them in the dressing. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, place two stuffed tomato halves, cut sides facing downwards, onto each of four serving plates. Drizzle over the parsley oil. Spoon the salad alongside.
