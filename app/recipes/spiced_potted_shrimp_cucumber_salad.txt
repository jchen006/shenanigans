Ingredients 
225g/8oz clarified butter
14 tsp ground ginger
14 tsp hot chilli powder
14 tsp smoked paprika
12 tsp mild curry powder
12 tsp garam masala
500g/17oz fresh boiled shrimps, peeled
50ml/2fl oz light olive oil 
splash white wine vinegar
12 cucumber, peeled, cut in half lengthways, seeds scooped out using a spoon, flesh sliced into half-moon shapes
salt and white pepper
4 medium slices white bread
small bunch fresh coriander shoots
Instructions 
For the potted shrimp, melt the butter and spices in a pan over a low to medium heat, stirring well to combine.
Add the shrimps and stir to coat them in the spiced butter, keeping the heat set to low so that the shrimps are warmed through gently without becoming tough.
Spoon the potted shrimp mixture into four ramekins, press down using the back of a spoon and set aside to cool. When cool, cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for 3-4 hours, or overnight.
Remove the ramekins from the fridge at least one hour before serving, to allow the contents to return to room temperature.
When ready to serve, make the salad.
For the salad, pour the oil and vinegar into a bowl and whisk well. Add the cucumber slices and stir to dress them in the vinaigrette. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. (Prepare this in advance if you want the cucumber to soften)
To serve, toast four slices of white bread until golden-brown on both sides. Place one ramekin into the centre of each of four serving plates. Cut the toast into triangles and arrange four triangles alongside each ramekin. Garnish each plate with a coriander shoot.
