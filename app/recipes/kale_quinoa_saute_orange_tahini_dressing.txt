Ingredients 
350g/12oz quinoa
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 tsp coconut oil
600g/1lb 512oz kale, tough stalks discarded, leaves shredded, washed
1 fat garlic clove, finely chopped
1 large handful chopped fresh coriander or flatleaf parsley, to garnish
1 unwaxed orange, zest only, finely sliced
sea salt
212 tbsp tahini
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 garlic clove
6 tbsp warm (boiled) water
4 tbsp orange juice
salt and freshly ground black pepper 
Instructions 
Put the quinoa in a bowl and cover with approximately 700ml/114 pints cold water. Add a pinch of salt. Set aside to soak overnight (or for at least 8 hours).
Drain the quinoa and transfer to a very large saucepan. Cover with 350ml/12fl oz water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender.
Drain the quinoa and put in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle over the olive oil and season with sea salt.
Meanwhile, for the dressing, whisk together all of the dressing ingredients until smooth, creamy and well combined, adding a splash of warm water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Heat the coconut oil in a frying pan over a medium heat until melted. Add the kale and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, adding  the garlic after 1 minute. Continue to fry until the kale is just tender, then tip it into the quinoa and stir to combine.
To serve, divide the kale and quinoa saute equally among 4 plates, garnish with the orange zest. Drizzle over the tahini dressing and scatter over the herbs.
