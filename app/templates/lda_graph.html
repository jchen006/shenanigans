                One experiment we wanted to try was a basic clustering of recipes. For our first attempt, we wanted an unsupervised clustering - a way to cluster without manually labeling or providing pre-defined clusters for the recipes. For this goal, Latent Dirichlet
                Allocation (LDA) seemed a perfect fit, as it assigns “topics” for “documents” consisting of “words”. In our case, it assigns clusters for recipes consisting of ingredients. It does this by building a basic probabilistic model of the relationships
                (bayesian conditional probabilities) between ingredients and recipe, recipes and cluster, and ingredients and clusters. Although we want to find a cluster for each recipe, in reality LDA assigns each recipe a probability distribution -
                namely the probability a recipe belongs to each of K clusters, where the number K is chosen as an input parameter. With this ‘distribution’ over K topics
