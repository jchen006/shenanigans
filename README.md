*Need to add settings for dataset sizes 

(1) How we want to show the graph with edges part (Recipes in relation to ingredients? Highlighting the ingredients path)
(2) What other graphs do we want to show? 

- Machine Learning Labels of Recipes and percentage it might be a certain cuisine 
For instance Korean Short Rib Taco a percentage bar of 70% korean and 30% mexican 
- suggested types of ingredients to go with other ingredients pairing percentages 


(3) How we want to label each recipe and ingredient aka what categories are we going to label them by. Also is ingredient going to be a feature when we run machine learning? 
(4) How are we going to dynamically show stats for each recipe and for each ingredient? 
(5) how are we going to make our site look sexy 
(6) Make the pipeline a lot more smoother so that the user can define the dataset size
