Ingredients 
200g/7oz minced pork belly
300g/1012oz minced mixed game (such as venison, pheasant and mallard)
2 free-range eggs, plus 1 free-range egg yolk, beaten, for egg wash
small handful fresh thyme leaves
50g/134oz cooked chestnuts, finely chopped 
pinch allspice 
1 x 500g/1lb 2oz packet puff pastry
plain flour, for dusting
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp butter
100g/312oz wild mushrooms 
50ml/2fl oz double cream
1 tsp Dijon mustard 
2 pickled walnuts, drained, chopped 
2 dandelion leaves 
Instructions 
For the game sausage roll, preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.
In a large bowl, mix together the minced pork and minced game. Mix in the eggs, thyme, chestnuts and allspice until well combined, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
Roll out the puff pastry onto a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle measuring approximately 30x20cm/12x8in.
Shape the mince mixture into a sausage about the same length as the longest edge of the rectangle. Place it on top of the pastry, then roll the pastry around the filling mixture, pressing the ends to seal and crimping with a fork.
Brush the top of the sausage roll all over with the beaten egg yolk, then bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastry has risen and is golden-brown.
For the garnish, heat the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the mushrooms and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until all of the water has been released from the mushrooms and has evaporated.
Add the double cream and bring the mixture to the boil.
Transfer the pan contents to a food processor and blend to a coarse puree. Add the mustard and pulse to combine.
To serve, slice the sausage roll into thick slices and divide the slices equally between 2 plates. Spoon the mushroom garnish alongside. Garnish the sausage roll with a few pieces of pickled walnut and a dandelion leaf.
