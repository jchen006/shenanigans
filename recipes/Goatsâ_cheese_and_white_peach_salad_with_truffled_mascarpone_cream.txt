Ingredients 
40g/1Â½oz cobnuts, shelled and finely chopped
50g/2oz breadcrumbs
2 x 125g/4Â½oz Crottin de Chavignol goatsâ cheese
2 white peaches, halved, stones removed
1 tbsp honey, plus extra for drizzling
few shavings fresh black truffle
150g/5Â½oz mascarpone
100g/3Â½oz frisÃ©e (curly endive)
100g/3Â½oz red chard
alfalfa sprouts, to garnish
Instructions 
Pre-heat the grill to medium-high heat.
In a bowl, combine the chopped cobnuts with the breadcrumbs.
Cut the goatsâ cheeses on a diagonal in half and roll in the cobnut breadcrumbs.
Place the halved peaches onto a baking tray and drizzle with honey. Grill until golden-brown.
Meanwhile, grate a little black truffle into the mascarpone and mix until well combined.
Toss together the frisÃ©e with the red chard and divide among four serving plates. Place a slice of the goatsâ cheese and half a peach on top of each plate. Drizzle a little more honey over, finish with a dollop of the truffled mascarpone and a sprinkle of alfalfa sprouts.
