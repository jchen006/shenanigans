Ingredients 
150g/6oz free-range egg whites
300g/10Â½oz caster sugar
2 tsp cornflour
1 tsp white wine vinegar
300ml/10Â½fl oz double cream
250g/9oz caster sugar
50ml/2fl oz water
250ml/9fl oz fresh orange and peach juice
6 ripe peaches
50g/2oz unsalted butter, softened until runny but not melted
150g/5oz raspberries
110g/4oz whole almonds, out of their shells
Instructions 
For the pavlovas, preheat the oven to 140C/280F/Gas 1.
Place the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Add the sugar, a spoonful at a time, while whisking continuously. Whisk until all of the sugar is incorporated and stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gently fold in the cornflour and white wine vinegar.

Line a baking tray with parchment paper and place six large spoonfuls of the pavlova mixture onto the tray, in small rounds with a small hollow in the middle. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until crisp but not coloured, then turn the oven off and leave for 2-3 hours (or preferably overnight).
Just before serving, whip the double cream in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.

For the roasted peaches, preheat the oven to 170C/340F/Gas 3.
Place 150g/5oz of the sugar into a heavy-based pan with the water and dissolve over a low heat, stirring occasionally to make a syrup. When the sugar syrup is completely clear, increase the heat and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the mixture changes colour to a light caramel.
Remove the pan from the heat and carefully stir in the orange and peach juice (be careful as the mixture may spit). Set aside to cool.
Using a mini blowtorch, blacken the skins of the peaches, then use a clean cloth to wipe the skins away. Brush the peeled peaches with the soft butter, using a pastry brush. Sprinkle the peaches with the remaining sugar, making sure they are thoroughly coated (alternatively, sprinkle the sugar on a plate and roll the peaches in it).

Place the peaches into a small roasting tin and spoon the caramel over. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes, basting the peaches every ten minutes, until the peaches are golden-brown and caramelised.
Add the raspberries and almonds to the roasting tin during the final ten minutes of cooking.
To serve, place a meringue round each onto six serving plates. Spoon the whipped cream on top and place a peach in the centre of each meringue. Spoon the caramel sauce around and scatter the raspberries and almonds over and around.
