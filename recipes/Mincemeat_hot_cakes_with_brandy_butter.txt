Melt a thin slice of butter in a non-stick frying pan over a low to medium heat. Add large spoonfuls of the mincemeat mixture to the pan and leave to colour lightly on the underside. Flip over with a palette knife or fish slice then let the other side colour lightly.
When the hot cakes are browned and cooked through, serve on warm plates with a dollop of brandy butter.
