Ingredients 
1.4 kg/3lb pumpkin
4 firm tomatoes, roughly chopped
500g/1lb 2oz Bramley apples, peeled and roughly chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
125g/4Â½oz dried mixed fruit
125g/4Â½oz soft light brown sugar
2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground mixed spice 
1 tsp ground black pepper
750ml/1Â¼pints cider vinegar
bunch fresh herbs, such as thyme or tarragon
Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3.
With a large cook's knife, carefully cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds. Remove the skin from the pumpkin and chop into small cubed pieces, about 1Â½cm/Â½in across.
Place all the ingredients, except the herbs, in a large saucepan. Bring to the boil, before reducing the heat to a simmer.
Simmer gently, uncovered, for about 30-45 minutes until the pumpkin is tender.
While the pumpkin is cooking, sterilise the jars. Thoroughly wash 4 x 500ml glass jars in hot soapy water, rinse well in boiling water and turn upside down to drain. Transfer to the oven and heat for about ten minutes, or until thoroughly dry.
Roughly chop the fresh herbs, and add to the pumpkin, stirring to combine.
Spoon into the hot, sterilised, glass jars.
To enjoy the chutney at its best, store in a cool, dark, dry place for about 2-3 weeks before eating - this allows time for the flavours to mature. The chutney can be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, for up to six months unopened. Once opened, keep the chutney in the fridge and consume within two weeks.
