Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured board. Use to line either four individual 10cm/4in loose bottomed flan rings or one 20cm/8in large one. Do not trim the excess pastry yet. Prick the base all over and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Bake blind for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is cooked, then trim off the excess.
