175g/6oz button mushrooms, sliced

Instructions 
For the pan-fried grey mullet fillet, season the flesh side of the grey mullet with salt and freshly ground pepper.
Heat a frying pan until hot, add the olive oil and place the fish in the pan, skin-side down. When the skin of the mullet is golden-brown and crisp, turn the fish over to finish cooking and then add a squeeze of lime.
Meanwhile, for the vegetables, heat the sesame oil in a pan, add the beansprouts, shiitake mushrooms and mangetout, along with a pinch of salt. Stir fry for a few minutes.
Once the vegetables have softened, add the toasted sesame seeds and mix well.
For the lemongrass and white wine sauce, heat a frying pan until hot and add half of the butter, the shallots, lemongrass and a pinch of salt.
Gently fry until the shallots are soft, but not browned.
Add the fish stock and cook until the liquid is reduced by half.
Place the wine in a separate pan and simmer until it is reduced by a third. Add the wine to the reduced stock.
Add the cream, bring to the boil and then immediately turn down the heat to a simmer. Cook until thickened slightly; then pass through a sieve into a clean pan.
Whisk in the remaining butter and season with salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste.
Pile the vegetables onto each plate. Place the fish onto the vegetables and spoon the sauce over and around. Serve.
