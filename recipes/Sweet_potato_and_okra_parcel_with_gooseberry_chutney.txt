1kg/2lb 2oz sweet potato, cut into cubes 
100g/3Â½oz okra
1 tbsp vegetable oil
2 onions, sliced
1 tbsp jerk seasoning paste
100g/3Â½oz spinach
1 tbsp chopped mint
6 pieces puff pastry, 15cm/6in square, 3mm/Â½in thick
2 eggs, beaten
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
400g/14oz gooseberries
150g/5Â½oz demerara sugar
150ml/5Â½fl oz cider vinegar
Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Lightly flour a baking tray.
Cook the sweet potato in a saucepan of boiling salted water for 4-5 minutes, or until tender. Drain and set aside.
Blanch the okra in a pan of boiling, salted water for 1-2 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and fry the onions for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown.
Mix the sweet potato, okra, onions, jerk seasoning, spinach, and mint together in a bowl until well combined.
Divide the mixture into six and shape into balls.  Place each ball into the middle of each square of puff pastry and roll up into parcels.
Place each parcel onto the baking tray and brush with the beaten egg. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until golden-brown.
Meanwhile, for the chutney, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the onion and garlic for 4-5 minutes, or until soft.
Add the gooseberries, sugar and vinegar and cook for a further 25-30 minutes, or until soft and sticky.
Serve the gooseberry chutney alongside the sweet potato parcels.
