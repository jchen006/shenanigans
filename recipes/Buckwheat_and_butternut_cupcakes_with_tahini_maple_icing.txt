Ingredients 
300g/10Â½oz cooked butternut squash
140g/4Â¾oz buckwheat flour
1 tbsp ground cinnamon
4 tbsp coconut oil, melted
4 tbsp maple syrup
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp baking powder
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1Â½ tbsp maple syrup
130g/4Â½oz coconut oil
2 tbsp tahini
2 tsp vanilla extract
dried edible rose petals or grated vegan chocolate, to decorate
Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Line a 12-hole cupcake tray with paper cases.
Blend all of the cupcakes ingredients and 3 tablespoons water together in a food processor until smooth and well combined.
Divide the batter equally among the cupcake cases (about 3 tablespoons per paper case). Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cupcakes comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the tin and set aside to cool on a wire rack until completely cold.
Meanwhile, whip the icing ingredients together with an electric whisk until light and fluffy. Chill in the fridge until the cupcakes have cooled, then whip again.
Transfer the tahini maple icing to a piping bag and ice the cupcakes. Sprinkle with the rose petals or grated vegan chocolate and serve.
