Ingredients 
750g/1lb 10oz Jerusalem artichokes
250g/9oz small potatoes
good glug of olive oil
2 lemons
salt and ground black pepper
2 large handfuls of fresh flatleaf parsley
small lump of parmesan
Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 200C/400C/Gas 6.
Give the artichokes and potatoes a good scrub (I donât bother peeling them). Cut them in half lengthways, then steam for 10-15 minutes, or until they are showing the first signs of tenderness.
Tip the steamed vegetables into a roasting tin. Pour in the olive oil and toss gently. Halve the lemons and squeeze the juice of one and a half of them over the vegetables. Tuck the empty lemon shells in around the vegetables. Season well and roast for 30-35 minutes, or until sticky around the edges.
To serve, spoon the vegetables onto plates and sprinkle over plenty of flatleaf parsley. Squeeze over the remaining lemon juice and add a few slithers of parmesan to each serving.
