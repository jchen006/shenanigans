Sauteed Broccoli Rabe
http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/anne-burrell/sauteed-broccoli-rabe-recipe2.html

 Kosher salt
1 bunch broccoli rabe, tough, non-leafy stems removed
 Extra-virgin olive oil
3 cloves garlic, smashed
 Pinch crushed  red pepper flakes
Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of well salted ice water. Drop the broccoli rabe into the boiling water and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the boiling water and plunge immediately into the ice water. Once cool remove from the ice water and let dry. It can be used right away or held for future use.
Coat a large saute pan with olive oil. Add the smashed garlic and crushed red pepper and bring to medium heat. Once the garlic is brown and aromatic, remove it from the pan and discard. It has fulfilled its garlic destiny. Add the broccoli rabe and toss around in the oil to heat up and season. Remember the broccoli is already cooked. Add more oil, if needed and season with salt if needed (it probably will).
