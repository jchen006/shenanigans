Ingredients 
a handful of leftover roast parsnips or roast potatoes
a handful of leftover Brussels sprouts
salt and black pepper
a handful of crumbled goats cheese
plain flour, for dusting
a little vegetable oil, for frying
tomato or onion chutney (preferably homemade), to serve
Instructions 
Chop the Brussels sprouts. Crush the roast parsnips or roast potatoes with a potato masher and mix them with the sprouts. Season with salt and black pepper.
With lightly floured hands, roll large spoonfuls of the mixture into little cakes. Make a small dent in each cake and add a little goats cheese, then reshape the cakes, enclosing the cheese as you go. Dust the cakes with a little flour.
Warm a very thin layer of oil (or a mixture of oil and butter) in a non-stick pan, then lower in the cakes a few at a time. Leave them for five minutes or so, until they have a crisp crust underneath, then turn and cook them on the other side, until crisp on both sides and warmed through.
Serve with the onion or tomato chutney.
