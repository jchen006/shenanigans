http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/broccoli-soup-recipe.html

 pin2 tablespoons  unsalted butter or  olive oil
1 medium onion, sliced
1 clove garlic, smashed
1 russet potato, peeled and diced
 Pinch dried thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
4 cups  chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
1 (16-ounce) package frozen broccoli, thawed
2 to 4 tablespoons cream or half-and-half, optional
 Freshly ground black pepper
 Optional toppings: shaved  Parmesan, shredded cheddar or crumbled bacon
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan, over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the potato, thyme, salt, and broth and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook uncovered until the potato is fork tender, about 10 minutes. Add the broccoli and simmer for 3 minutes.
Puree the soup in batches in a blender or with an immersion blender. Return soup to the pot and add the cream. Bring to a simmer, taste, and season with salt and pepper.
Serve with optional toppings.
