1/4 red onion, thinly sliced
2 slices bacon, cut in small pieces, cooked to crisp
1/2 bunch broccoli, cut into small florets (about 1 1/2 cups)
1/2 small head  cauliflower, cut into small florets (about 1 1/2 cups)
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon  red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon  Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons  vegetable oil
1/4 cup  mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Shock the onions in an ice water bath for 10 minutes to temper the sharp flavor, and pat dry.
Place the bacon, broccoli, cauliflower and onions in a large salad bowl. In a small bowl, whisk the sugar, vinegar and Dijon mustard. Slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking to make an emulsion. Mix in the mayonnaise and seafood seasoning. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss.
