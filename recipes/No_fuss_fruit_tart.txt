Nigella Lawson
Ingredients 
375g/13oz digestive biscuits
75g/3oz softened unsalted butter
400g/14oz cream cheese, at room temperature
240g/8Â½oz ready-made lemon curd, at room temperature
125g/4oz fresh blueberries
125g/4oz fresh blackberries
125g/4oz fresh raspberries
125g/4oz fresh redcurrants or pomegranate seeds
125g/4oz fresh small strawberries, half hulled, half stalks intact
Instructions 
Process the biscuits and the butter to a sandy rubble in a food processor, then press the mixture into the sides and bottom of the tart tin. Place in the freezer (or fridge if that is not possible) for about 10â15 minutes.
Clean the bowl of the food processor, then process the cream cheese and lemon curd and spread it into the bottom of the chilled tart tin, covering the base of the tart evenly. (Alternatively, just mix the cream cheese and lemon curd together by hand.)
Arrange all of the fruit gently (so that it doesnât sink into the filling too much) on top of the lemony cream cheese in a decorative manner.
Place the tart in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. It does need to get properly cold in order to set enough for the tart to be unsprung and sliced easily.
