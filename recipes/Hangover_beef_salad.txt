Ingredients 
250g/9oz Puy lentils or other small, green lentils
stock or water, to cover
1 medium-sized onion, peeled and chopped
1 fresh bay leaf
1 garlic clove
sea salt flakes
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
Â½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
ground black pepper
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 short lump of fresh horseradish, for grating
1 handful fresh flatleaf parsley, roughly torn or chopped
leftover rare roast beef, thinly sliced  (3 or 4 slices per person), to serve
Instructions 
Put the lentils in a saucepan, cover with the stock (or water) and add the onion, bay leaf and garlic. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but retain some bite.
Meanwhile, make the dressing. Put a pinch of sea salt into a small bowl, add the red wine vinegar, mustard and a little ground black pepper, then beat in the olive oil until well combined. Peel the horseradish and grate finely into a separate bowl. Stir it into the dressing a little at a time. You need a couple of teaspoons of it, but add more or less to taste.
When the lentils are done, drain well and add the dressing while they are still warm. Mix in the parsley.
Place thin slivers of beef amongst the lentils, scatter over a little more sea salt, and serve.
