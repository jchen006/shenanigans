Ingredients 
150g/5oz scotch beef fillet, sliced thinly
20ml/Â¾fl oz sake
20ml/Â¾fl oz soy sauce
1 tsp grated fresh ginger
Â½ tsp soft brown sugar
Â½ garlic clove, finely chopped
1 small red chilli, finely chopped
110g/4oz asparagus, chopped into thin sticks (julienne)
75g/3oz mangetout, chopped into thin sticks (julienne)
2 tsp sesame oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper 
2 tsp sesame seeds, to serve
2 sprigs fresh coriander, to garnish
Instructions 
Place the beef fillet, sake, soy sauce, ginger, sugar, garlic and chilli into a bowl and mix together well. Set aside and marinate for 30 minutes.
Heat a wok until hot and add the beef mixture. Stir-fry for two minutes, until the meat is browned all over.
Add the asparagus and mangetout and continue to stir-fry for a further 2-3 minutes, until the vegetables are just tender and the beef is cooked through.
Add the sesame oil and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
To serve, spoon the stir fry onto two plates and sprinkle each with the sesame seeds and garnish with a sprig of coriander.
