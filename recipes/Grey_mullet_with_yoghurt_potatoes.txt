Ingredients 
1 tsp cumin seeds
300ml/10Â½fl oz natural yoghurt
300ml/10Â½fl oz water
pinch ground turmeric
pinch chilli powder
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground cumin
pinch salt
1 tsp dark brown sugar
2 green chillies
450g/1lb potatoes, par-boiled for four minutes, cooled, peeled, cut into cubes
4 x 150g grey mullet fillets
salt and freshly ground black pepper
30ml/1fl oz vegetable oil
1 tbsp butter
fresh coriander leaves, to garnish
lime wedges, to garnish
Instructions 
Place a dry pan over a medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and dry fry for three minutes, or until just turning a darker brown. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.
Place the yoghurt, water, turmeric, chilli powder, ground coriander, ground cumin, salt and sugar into a bowl and mix well.
Add the yoghurt mixture to the pan of toasted cumin seeds. Return to the heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for three minutes.
Add the whole chillies and the par-boiled potato cubes and simmer for 8-10 minutes, until the potatoes are completely cooked through.
For the grey mullet, season the mullet fillets well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Heat the oil in a frying pan and, when hot, add the mullet fillets and cook for two minutes on each side.
Add the butter to the pan and allow to melt and foam. Spoon the pan juices over the mullet fillets and cook until the fish is completely cooked through.
To serve, spoon some of the potatoes and their sauce onto each plate. Place a mullet fillet on top of each pile of potatoes and garnish with fresh coriander leaves and lime wedges.
