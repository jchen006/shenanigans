Slice the salmon at an angle - each piece needs to be about 2-3mm thick.
Lay four slices evenly in a straight line onto each serving plate.
Spoon all but two tablespoons of the ceviche dressing over the salmon. Set aside for about 30 minutes.
For the salad, soak the sliced fennel in iced water for 2-3 minutes, before removing and draining. Mix with the salad leaves and the reserved two tablespoons of the ceviche dressing.
Place the fennel salad on top of the salmon and serve.
