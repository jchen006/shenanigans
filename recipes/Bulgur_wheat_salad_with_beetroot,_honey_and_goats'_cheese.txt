Ingredients 
1 large parsnip, peeled and cut into short batons
2 carrots, peeled and cut into short batons
3 tbsp olive oil
100g/3Â½oz bulgur wheat, rinsed
1 tbsp clear honey
Â½-1 tsp dried chilli flakes, to taste
Â½ lemon, juice only
25g/1oz chopped fresh flatleaf parsley
150g/5oz vacuum-packed cooked beetroot, drained, cubed
100g/3Â½oz soft goats' cheese, finely chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 warm flatbreads, to serve
Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Line a baking tray or small roasting tin with aluminium foil.
Put the parsnips and carrots on the baking tray and drizzle over 1 tablespoon of the oil. Season with salt and pepper and roast for 18-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, half-fill a saucepan with water and bring to the boil. Add the bulgur and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until almost tender.
Drizzle the roasted vegetables with the honey and sprinkle with the chilli flakes, turning to coat all over. Return to the oven for a further 10 minutes, or until golden-brown and sticky.
Drain the bulgur and transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the roasted vegetables. Add the lemon juice and most of the parsley and stir again. Season with salt and pepper.
Spoon the bulgur wheat salad onto a serving platter. Sprinkle over the beetroot and goats' cheese. Garnish with the remaining parsley and oil. Serve with flatbreads.
