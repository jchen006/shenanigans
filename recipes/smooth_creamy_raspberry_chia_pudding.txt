Ingredients 
400g/14oz of full-fat creme fraiche (preferably organic)
6 tbsp chia seeds (available from health food stores)
2 tbsp vanilla extract
4 tsp honey, preferably raw, to taste
300g/1012 raspberries
20 drops pure stevia extract (available from health food stores)
small handful toasted desiccated coconut or chopped almonds
12 unwaxed orange, grated zest only
Instructions 
Blend the creme fraiche with the chia seeds, vanilla extract, honey, raspberries (reserving a handful of the raspberries for the garnish) and salt until smooth and well combined. Add the stevia, taking care to taste after each drop as stevia is very sweet.
Chill the chia mixture in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.
To serve, divide the chia pudding equally among 4 serving bowls. Garnish with the reserved raspberries, toasted nuts and orange zest.
