Ingredients 
4 tbsp olive oil
8 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
4 onions, peeled and chopped
4 tsp grated, fresh ginger
1Â½ tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
3 tsp ground cinnamon
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
3kg/7lb shoulder of lamb, boned, fat removed and cut into 4cm/1Â½in cubes
2 tbsp tomato purÃ©e 
2kg/4Â½lb ripe tomatoes or 4 X 400g/14oz can tomatoes, coarsely chopped
4-5 tbsp honey
1 large or 2 small pomegranates
800g/1Â¾lb couscous
6 tbsp olive oil
2 lemons, juice only
1 litre/1Â¾ pints boiling chicken stock or water
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tbsp chopped, fresh mint or coriander
1 lime, cut into wedges
bowl Greek yoghurt
Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas 2.
For the lamb tagine, heat a large ovenproof casserole or heavy saucepan on a medium to high heat.
Add the olive oil, garlic, onions, ginger and spices and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir, then cook, covered, on a low heat for about ten minutes, until the onions are soft.
Add the lamb, tomato purÃ©e, chopped tomatoes and honey into the saucepan, stir throughly.
Bring to the simmer and place in the oven for 1Â½ hours, until the lamb is tender.
Remove the lid of the saucepan halfway through the cooking time to let the liquid reduce and thicken.
If the sauce is still a bit thin, put the saucepan on the hob on a medium heat and without the lid. Stir occasionally and let the liquid reduce until a thick sauce begins to appear.
Meanwhile, for the couscous, cut the pomegranates in half and scoop out the seeds using a teaspoon and remove the white membrane around the seeds.
