Ingredients 
vegetable oil, for deep frying
75g/3oz butter
1 tbsp olive oil
8 teal, cleaned and wishbone removed
1 lemon, juice only
6 salsify roots, washed and dried
250ml/9fl oz chicken stock
450g/1lb purple sprouting broccoli
200g/7oz pancetta, sliced into lardons
75g/3oz plain flour
200ml/7fl oz ready-made game jus
Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 220C/430F/Gas 8 and heat the oil in a deep fat fryer to 180C/350F, or until a breadcrumb sizzles and browns when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended.)
Heat a frying pan over a medium heat, add a little of the butter and olive oil and fry the teal until just browned on all sides. Place the teal into a roasting tin, transfer to the oven and roast for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through.
Remove the teal from the oven and leave in a warm place, covered, to rest for a few minutes.
Fill a bowl with water and squeeze a little of the lemon juice into the bowl. Peel four of the salsify and place into the lemon water to prevent oxidization. Once all the salsify is peeled, slice thickly and return it to the bowl.
Heat a frying pan until hot, and add the remaining butter and lemon juice. Drain the salsify and add it to the pan. Fry for a couple of minutes.
Add the chicken stock to the pan, bring to a simmer and cook until the salsify is tender - about 3-4 minutes.
Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, then add the broccoli and cook for two minutes. Drain and refresh the broccoli in a bowl of cold water, then drain once more.
Heat a frying pan until hot, add the pancetta, cook for one minute then add the cooked salsify and broccoli and mix together to heat through.
Using a sharp knife or vegetable peeler, peel the remaining salsify (leaving the skin on) into ribbons. Dust with the flour.
Add the peeled salsify to the deep-fat fryer and fry until golden-brown. Remove the salsify with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
Return the roasting pan used to cook the teal to the heat, add the game jus and deglaze the pan, stirring the pan with a wooden spoon to release any meat sediment.
