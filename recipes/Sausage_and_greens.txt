Ingredients 
250g/9oz curly kale
250g/9oz cooking chorizo
50g/2oz skinned whole almonds
a little groundnut or sunflower oil
a clove of garlic, peeled and crushed
sea salt flakes
Instructions 
Wash the kale thoroughly â the leaves can hold grit in their curls. Put several of the leaves on top of one another and shred them coarsely, discarding the really thick ends of the stalks as you go. Repeat this until all of the kale leaves are shredded. Set aside.

Cut the chorizo into thick slices. Warm a non-stick frying pan over a moderate heat, add the slices of chorizo and fry until the pieces are golden. Lift them out with a draining spoon onto a dish lined with kitchen paper. Discard the oil that has come out of the chorizo and wipe the pan clean.
Add the almonds to the same pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until pale golden, then lift out and set aside with the chorizo.
Warm the oil in the same pan, add the crushed garlic and shredded kale and cook for a couple of minutes, turning the kale over as it cooks, until glossy and starting to darken in colour.
Return the chorizo and almonds to the pan, add a little salt and continue cooking until all is sizzling. To serve, tip onto hot plates.
