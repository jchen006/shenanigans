Ingredients 
90g/314oz extra virgin rapeseed oil 
20 garlic cloves (about 200g/7oz), peeled
1 red onion, quartered, keeping the stalk end intact
1 fennel, quartered
4 violet artichoke hearts
2 baby chicory, halved
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 sprigs thyme
1 sprig rosemary 
2 bay leaves
4 sage leaves
80g/3oz balsamic vinegar, preferably aged 8 years
2 tbsp pumpkin seeds, toasted
30g/1oz parmesan shavings
50g/134oz air-dried ham (such as Bayonne or Parma ham), torn
6 rye bread croutons
Instructions 
For the braised summer vegetables, preheat the oven to 120C/250F/Gas 1.
Heat the rapeseed oil on a medium heat in a large oven-proof saucepan and fry the garlic for 5-7 minutes, or until golden-brown. Add the remaining vegetables, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and continue to cook for five minutes.
Add the herbs, vinegar and 80g/3oz water. Stir to combine and place in the oven for 75-85 minutes.
To serve, arrange the roasted vegetables on a large platter and garnish with the seeds, parmesan shavings, ham slices and croutons.
