1 head broccoli
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon crushed  red pepper flakes
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Trim the woody skin off the broccoli stem and slice the broccoli into nice long "trees". In a large saucepan, mix the water, olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli and cover to steam. After 3 minutes, turn off the heat, and allow the broccoli to sit for another couple of minutes. Toss to coat and serve.
