Transfer to the oven and bake for 7-10 minutes, or until golden-brown and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then turn out onto a sheet of baking paper.
For the filling, spread the jam over the cake, followed by the cream.
Place the marshmallows into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on full for about 15 seconds, or until beginning to soften. Spoon the marshmallows on top of the cream.
Spread the raspberries along the edges of the cake, then roll the cake up in a cigar shape. Dust with icing sugar.
