Spoon the cake batter into the baking dish and scatter over the blueberries and peach slices.
Sprinkle over half of the crumble topping and bake for 40-50 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile for the jam, heat the peaches and the juice from the can, blueberries, sugar, flour and juice in a saucepan over a medium heat until boiling. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and jammy. Remove the pan from the heat.
Spread the jam over the cake and sprinkle over the remaining crumble topping.
Return the cake to the oven and bake for a further 8-10 minutes, or until the topping is crisp and golden-brown.
