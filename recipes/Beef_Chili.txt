http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/beef-chili-recipe.html

1 1/2 pounds beef round, cut into 1-inch chunks
 Kosher salt and pepper
6 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 to 2 teaspoons chipotle chili powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 tablespoons fine corn meal
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 (14.5-ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained
 Fresh salsa, homemade or store-bought, for serving
 Lime wedges and cooked brown rice, for serving
Season the beef with salt and pepper. Heat a Dutch oven over medium heat with 2 teaspoons vegetable oil; sear the beef in two batches, adding up to 2 teaspoons more vegetable oil, until browned on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the beef to a plate as it browns. 
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the pot; add the onion, red pepper and garlic. Cook, stirring, until onion is soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the cocoa, chili powder, oregano, cumin and coriander; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the corn meal and tomato paste and cook until the tomato paste sticks to bottom and caramelizes, about 2 minutes. Stir in 6 cups water, scraping tomato paste from bottom of pan; bring to a simmer. Add the reserved beef and beans; partially cover the pot and adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer until the beef is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
3. Serve chili with fresh salsa, lime wedges, and brown rice, if desired.
