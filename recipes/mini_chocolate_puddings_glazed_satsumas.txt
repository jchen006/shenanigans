Ingredients 
150g/512oz unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
150g/512oz self-raising flour
150g/512oz brown sugar
1 free-range egg
1 tbsp cocoa powder
2 satsumas, peeled and sliced in half sideways
1 tbsp icing sugar
150ml/5fl oz milk
150ml/5fl oz double cream
50g/112oz brown sugar
2 tbsp cocoa powder
25g/1oz unsalted butter
Instructions 
Preheat a baking sheet in the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
For the pudding, place all the pudding ingredients into the bowl of a food processor and blend until a smooth mixture is formed.
Spoon the pudding mixture into two greased ramekins.
Place the ramekins onto the hot baking tray and bake in the oven for 12 minutes, or until cooked through.
For the satsumas, dust the satsumas with icing sugar and place them onto a baking tray and bake for ten minutes.
For the sauce, place all the sauce ingredients apart from the butter into a saucepan and heat, while stirring, until the ingredients have melted and combined to form a smooth mixture. Add the butter and stir until it has melted and combined with the sauce.
To serve, remove the puddings from the ramekins and place them onto clean plates.  Spoon some of the sauce over the top of the puddings and garnish with the satsumas.
