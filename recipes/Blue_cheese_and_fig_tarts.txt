Ingredients 
2 sheets filo pastry (measuring 25x25cm/10x10in square)
a little melted butter 
3 ripe figs
100g/3Â½oz creamy blue cheese such as dolcelatte or roquefort
1 tsp lemon juice 
3 sage leaves, chopped 
sprinkling of ground paprika 
Instructions 
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
Brush two sheets of filo with butter and place on top of each other. Cut into 24 equal squares. Put the squares together in pairs on top of each other at a 45 degree angle to make a star shape. Press into the holes of a 12 mini-muffin tin. Repeat with the remaining pastry to make 24 mini tartlets.
Bake in the oven for about 5-10 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Transfer to a baking tray.
Chop the figs into small pieces, and divide between the filo cases. Put the cheese, lemon juice and sage into a bowl. Mash down with a fork, season with pepper, then spoon blobs of cheese mixture on top of the fig. Sprinkle lightly with paprika.
Bake in the oven for five minutes, or until the cheese has just melted.
