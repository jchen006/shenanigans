Ingredients 
225g/8oz egg noodles
2 tbsp sesame oil
100g/4oz chicken breast, skinned
212 tbsp finely chopped garlic
50g/2oz mangetout, trimmed
50g/2oz Parma ham or cooked ham, finely shredded
2 tsp light soy sauce
2 tsp dark soy sauce
1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
12 tsp salt
12 tsp freshly ground white pepper
12 tsp sugar
3 tbsp finely chopped spring onions
2 tsp sesame oil
2 tsp light soy sauce
2 tsp Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry
1 tsp sesame oil
12 tsp salt
12 tsp freshly ground white pepper
Instructions 
Cook the noodles by boiling them for 3-5 minutes in a pan of boiling water. Drain and plunge into cold water, drain again then toss with a little sesame oil.
Using a cleaver, slice the chicken breasts into fine shreds approximately 5cm (2 in) long.
To marinate the chicken, combine the chicken with the light soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, salt and pepper in a small bowl.
Mix well and leave to marinate for 20 minutes.
Heat a wok until it is very hot. Add one tablespoon of oil and, when it is very hot and slightly smoking, add chicken shreds.
Stir-fry the mixture for about two minutes, then transfer to a plate.
Reheat the wok, and add remaining oil. Add the garlic and stir-fry for 10 seconds. Add the mangetout and ham and fry for one minute.
Add noodles, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice wine, salt and pepper, the sugar and spring onions and continue to stir-fry for two minutes.
Return chicken to noodle mixture.
Continue to fry for 3-4 minutes, until chicken is cooked.
Stir in sesame oil and give a few final stirs.
Turn onto warm serving platter and serve at once.
