Ingredients 
2 egg yolks
2 tsp white wine vinegar
1 tsp Dijon mustard
150ml/5fl oz extra virgin olive oil
150ml/5fl oz rapeseed oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper 
200g/7oz white crabmeat 
4 tbsp finely chopped chives
1 cucumber
2 vanilla pods
2 limes, juice only
12-1 tsp caster sugar
3-4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper 
8 large scallops, cleaned and dried on kitchen paper
25g/1oz butter
1 punnet basil cress, to serve
Instructions 
For the crab mayonnaise, place the egg yolks, vinegar and mustard into a food processor and blend until well combined.
With the motor running, slowly add the oils and blend until pale and creamy. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Place four tablespoons of the mayonnaise into a bowl, along with the crabmeat and chives and mix (the remainder of the mayonnaise, if there is any, can be covered and stored in the fridge for up to two days).
For the cucumber and scallops, with a vegetable peeler, peel eight ribbons from the cucumber and set to one side, then cut the remainder into small batons and place in a small bowl.
Place a spoonful of the crab mayonnaise on one end of each ribbon of cucumber and roll each ribbon up into a cylinder. Set aside.
Using a sharp knife, scrape the seeds of the vanilla pods into a small bowl, add the lime juice, half a teaspoon of sugar and the olive oil and whisk together until emulsified. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and adjust the quantity of sugar if necessary. Pour the dressing over the cucumber batons and toss to coat.
Heat a non-stick frying pan until hot and add the scallops. Fry on each side for one minute, then add the butter and cook for a further minute.
To serve, remove the cucumber batons from the dressing and divide them between four plates, placing them in the centre of each plate; top with two scallops each.
Place two of cucumber and crab rolls on top of the scallops on each plate, one upright, one on its side. Scatter the basil cress around the plate and spoon over a little of the cucumber dressing. Serve
