Ingredients 
4 asparagus spears
1 tbsp olive oil
1 shallot, chopped
1 garlic clove, chopped
200g/7oz risotto rice (eg carnaroli or arborio)
250ml/9fl oz white wine
500ml/18fl oz hot vegetable stock
25g/1oz unsalted butter
75g/2Â¾oz parmesan, or similar vegetarian hard cheese, grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper 
150g/5Â½oz parmesan, or similar vegetarian hard cheese
Instructions 
Cook the asparagus in boiling water for a few minutes until just tender. Drain and allow them to cool, then chop into small pieces and set aside.
For the risotto, heat the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the shallot and garlic until softened but not coloured. Add the rice and fry for one minute, stirring frequently, until coated in the oil. Add the wine and simmer until absorbed by the rice.
Add the hot vegetable stock a ladleful at a time, stirring between each addition to allow the liquid to be completely absorbed, until the rice is cooked and all the stock has been absorbed. Add the asparagus, butter and parmesan, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well.
For the parmesan crisps, place six small handfuls of grated parmesan onto a non-stick baking sheet at wide intervals. Press the piles of parmesan down to flatten them, then transfer to the oven and bake for 6-8 minutes, until golden-brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool and set.
To serve, divide the risotto equally among two serving dishes and top with the parmesan crisps.
