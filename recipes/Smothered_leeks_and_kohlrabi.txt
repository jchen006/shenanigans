Ingredients 
3 leeks, trimmed and cut into 2cm/Â¾in lengths
2 kohlrabi (around 650g/1lb 7oz), trimmed, peeled and cut into 2cm/Â¾in cubes
3 large carrots (around 550g/1Â¼lb), peeled and cut into 2cm/Â¾in pieces
6 garlic cloves 
1 bay leaf
2 sprigs fresh thyme
water, to cover
salt and freshly ground black pepper
40g/1Â½oz butter
Instructions 
Place the leeks, kohlrabi, carrots and garlic into a wide shallow pan which will take them in a single layer. Tuck the herbs down among them.
Pour in enough water to come about 1.5cm/Â½in up the sides of the pan. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and dot with butter.
Bring up to the boil, then reduce the heat to the absolute minimum. Cover the pan with a lid or foil and leave to cook very gently for about an hour, stirring occasionally to make sure that it doesn't catch. If necessary add an extra splash of water, or if it ends up too watery, uncover and boil the water off. Either way, you are aiming to end up with meltingly tender vegetables, perhaps slightly patched with brown towards the end of cooking, with little more than a few tablespoonfuls of syrupy liquid left in the pan. Serve warm.
