http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/chicken-adobo-recipe.html

1 cup  white wine vinegar
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup light  brown sugar
4 cloves garlic, crushed
3/4 teaspoon crushed  red pepper flakes
2 dried bay leaves
12 chicken drumsticks
2 cups low-sodium  chicken broth
3 tablespoons arrowroot
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 2 large limes)
 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or cilantro
 Lime wedges
For the marinade: In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, red pepper flakes, and bay leaves. Whisk until the sugar has dissolved.
Arrange the chicken in a single layer in a 9-by-13-by-2-inch glass baking dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken and refrigerate for 2 hours, turning the chicken over halfway through.
Place the chicken and marinade in a large, high-sided skillet or Dutch oven and add the chicken broth. Bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 to 50 minutes, turning the chicken every 20 minutes, until cooked through and a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 165 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the liquid and arrange on a serving platter. Discard the bay leaves and garlic cloves. Whisk the arrowroot and lime juice into the liquid and bring the mixture to a boil. Cook until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Pour the sauce over the chicken or serve alongside as a dipping sauce. Sprinkle with chopped parsley or cilantro, if using, and garnish with lime wedges.
