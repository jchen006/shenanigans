Ingredients 
1.75-2kg/3lb 1312-4lb 612oz carpetshell clams
1 tbsp fermented salted Chinese black beans, rinsed
1 tsp sugar
2 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp vegetable oil
20g/34oz garlic, finely chopped
25g/1oz fresh root ginger, peeled, finely shredded
1 red chilli, halved lengthways, thinly sliced
120ml/414fl oz lager-style beer
12 lime, juice only
6 spring onions, thinly sliced
1 handful fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped
Instructions 
Wash the clams well in fresh water, discarding any that do not close when tapped against the work surface.
Place the salted black beans, sugar and sesame oil into a small bowl and mash into a coarse paste with a fork or spoon.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep pan over a medium-high heat, then add the garlic, ginger, chilli and black bean paste mixture. Stir-fry for a few seconds, then add the clams and beer and turn the heat up to high. Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the clams have opened (discard any clams that remain shut). Stir in the lime juice and spring onions.
To serve, divide the clams among four deep serving bowls and garnish with the chopped fresh coriander.
