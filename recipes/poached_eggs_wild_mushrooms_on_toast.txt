Crack eggs into separate cups. Pour from the cups into the water and poach for 3 minutes.  Remove using a slotted spoon.
Add 55g/2oz butter to a hot saucepan and saute the shallots or onions and garlic.
Now add the cleaned mushrooms and cook over a moderate heat, season and drain (mushrooms contain a lot of water).
Serve the mushrooms on the sliced brioche, top with the poached eggs and sprinkle with the chopped parsley.
