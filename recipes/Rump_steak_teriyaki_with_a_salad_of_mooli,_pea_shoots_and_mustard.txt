Ingredients 
4 x 175g/6oz 28-day aged rump steaks, cut about 2cm thick
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp mirin (available in Asian supermarkets)
3 tbsp Japanese soy sauce (you can substitute normal soy sauce)
3 tbsp sake
2 tbsp vegetable oil
Â¼ small red onion, finely sliced, soaked in iced water for 15 minutes
110g/4oz mooli (you may substitute ordinary radish), cut or peeled into thin strips
6 red radishes, finely sliced
1 handful pea shoots (or watercress)
4 tbsp fresh peas, blanched
2 tsp English mustard
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
Â½ tsp sugar
1 tsp wine vinegar
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
1-2 tbsp water
Instructions 
For the steak, season the steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Whisk the mirin, soy sauce and sake together in a bowl.
Heat a frying pan until hot, then add the oil and steaks and cook on each side for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan and place onto a plate. Leave to rest in a warm place.
Pour off any excess fat from the frying pan, then add the mirin, sake and soy sauce mixture. Bring to the boil and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until thickened and glossy.
Return the steaks to the frying pan and cook for one minute, or until cooked to your liking, continuously spooning the sauce over the steaks.
For the salad, place all of the salad ingredients into a bowl and mix well.
For the dressing, place all of the dressing ingredients into a separate bowl and mix well.
To serve, cut each steak into thick slices and place onto four plates. Add a handful of salad, then drizzle a little of the dressing over the salad and around the plate.
