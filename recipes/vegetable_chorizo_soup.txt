Ingredients 
1 tbsp olive oil
1 leek, cut into small chunks
1 large carrot, cut into small chunks
1 sweet potato, cut into small chunks 
1 celery stalk, cut into small chunks
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp ground cumin
1 x 400g/14oz can chopped tomatoes
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar 
small bunch thyme, tied together with string (optional)
570ml/1 pint vegetable stock
150g/5oz green beans, trimmed
1 raw chorizo sausage (about 110g/4oz), cut into small chunks
Instructions 
Heat the olive oil  in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the leek, carrot, sweet potato and celery and fry for 10-12 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften but don't colour.
Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add the cumin, tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, thyme, vegetable stock and green beans. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer for 40-45 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
Meanwhile, heat a frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the chorizo for 10-12 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.
Remove the thyme from the soup and stir in the chorizo. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Ladle the soup into warm soup bowls and serve with crusty bread on the side.
