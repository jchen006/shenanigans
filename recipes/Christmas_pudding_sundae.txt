Ingredients 
a little butter (or leftover brandy butter)
leftover cooked Christmas pudding
dash of brandy
vanilla ice cream, to serve
Instructions 
Melt a little butter in a frying pan (I use brandy butter if thereâs any still knocking around). Crumble in the leftover Christmas pudding. Pour in a glug of brandy just to keep it moist. When the mixture is piping hot, spoon it over ice cream (or layer it in sundae glasses with the ice cream).
