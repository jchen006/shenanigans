The Hairy Bikers
Ingredients 
18 freshly shucked oysters, or more if you like
grapeseed oil or vegetable oil, for deep frying
1 small jar mayonnaise, or make your own
1 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon
1 tbsp capers
1 tbsp finely chopped shallots
1 tsp French mustard
dash Tabasco
1 tbsp tomato purÃ©e
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp red wine vinegar
Â½ tsp cayenne pepper
1 tbsp horseradish sauce
225g/8oz cornmeal
1 tbsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground fennel
1 tsp cayenne pepper
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 eggs
285ml/Â½pint milk 
French stick, warmed
butter
crisp lettuce, such as cos, torn
Instructions 
To make the remoulade mix all the ingredients together. Taste and adjust any of the ingredients you think necessary.
For the cornmeal crust, combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
In a separate bowl, combine the egg and milk in a bowl for the egg wash.
Dry the freshly shucked oysters with kitchen towel then dip in the egg wash and then in the cornmeal crust mixture, coating liberally.
Heat the grapeseed or vegetable oil in a large pan for deep frying until a breadcrumb sizzles gently in it (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended).
Deep-fry the coated oysters until golden, about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towel.
Take a freshly warmed French stick, split down the middle and butter. Top with a layer of lettuce then drizzle over the remoulade sauce. Add the deep-fried oysters and cover with the other half of the French loaf.
Eat at once.
