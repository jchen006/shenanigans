Pasta ai Quattro Formaggi
http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/pasta-ai-quattro-formaggi.html

 Salt
1 tablespoon salted butter
12 white  button mushrooms, very thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, grated
1/2 cup white wine
1 pound  angel hair pasta
1 cup  heavy cream
1/2 cup grated  fontina cheese
1/2 cup grated  Parmesan
1/2 cup grated  Romano cheese
1/2 cup  goat cheese (chevre)
 Freshly ground black pepper
 Minced fresh parsley, for sprinkling
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
Add the butter to a large skillet over medium heat and add the mushrooms and garlic. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes, then add the wine and cook until evaporated.
Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package directions, leaning toward the al dente side. Do not overcook; this will take 1 to 2 minutes!
Add the cream to the skillet with the mushrooms. Drain the pasta (reserving some of the pasta water) and add the pasta to the mushrooms, along with the fontina, Parmesan, Romano, goat cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Stir gently to combine, adding hot pasta water as needed for consistency. Don't overmix; if there are little clumps of cheese here and there, it's fine! Taste and add more salt if needed. The mixing stage should happen very quickly.
Turn the pasta out into a large serving bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.
You can use the 4 cheeses above, or whatever 4 cheeses you'd like!
